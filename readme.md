To build this project:

```bash
$ npm i
$ cd ./web-app
$ npm i
```

To run the webapp on localhost, first install a local ssl certificate by following [this tutorial](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/HTTP/servers/how-to-create-a-HTTPS-server/) and then run `npm run dev` to run the app with nodemon or `npm start` to run on node.

To use the M4L device, simply open index.amxd in ableton after you have built the project. :)
